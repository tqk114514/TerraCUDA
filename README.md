# TerraCUDA

Offloads Minecraft's terrain noise generation from your CPU to your NVIDIA GPU.

## Requirements

- Minecraft / NeoForge `26.1.2` (NeoForge `26.1.2.114`)
- Java 25
- An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support

## Building

```bash
./gradlew build
```

The compiled mod jar is written to `build/libs/`.

## Testing

```bash
./gradlew test
```

The test suite checks the bit-exact reimplementations of vanilla's random and noise primitives
(`Xoroshiro128PlusPlus`, `RandomSupport`, `Mth`, `ImprovedNoise`, `PerlinNoise`, `NormalNoise`)
against the Minecraft classes themselves — the deobfuscated game is on the test classpath, so parity
is asserted without launching the game. Hardware-dependent CUDA tests skip themselves on machines
without an NVIDIA driver.

## Design notes

The implementation plan lives in [`docs/GPU_区块生成规划.md`](docs/GPU_区块生成规划.md).

## Development

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse. To refresh dependencies:

```bash
./gradlew --refresh-dependencies
```

To run a development client:

```bash
./gradlew runClient
```
